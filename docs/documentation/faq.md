    ## What is CFF's relation with GitHub? Is CFF a GitHub format?
    
    The Citation File Format project is a **completely independent and open community project** with its own [governance](../governance).

    **GitHub are a user of the Citation File Format.**
    Specifically, they use the [`ruby-cff`](https://github.com/citation-file-format/ruby-cff) library to render citation information
    provided as a `CITATION.cff` file in a GitHub repository
    in the citation widget you can see on the repository page (example below).

    This said, we are happy that GitHub have chosen to use CFF to display citation information on their repositories (thanks, Arfon :wave:).
    This has given the project a lot of visibility, and helped integrations with other platforms such as Zenodo, Zotero and JabRef as well!
