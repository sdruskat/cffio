# Citation File Format

The **Citation File Format** is a format for plain text `CITATION.cff` files with human- and machine-readable **citation information for software** (and datasets).
You can include `CITATION.cff` files in your repositories to let others know how to correctly cite your software.

<!-- Add after "Create" button once available on cffinit, add blank lines between buttons
[Validate a `CITATION.cff` file](#){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

# The Citation File Format project

The Citation File Format makes it easier for research software engineers and researchers to make their software citable, and for their users to cite it.

**We do this by**

- maintaining and further developing a schema for a file format for software citation metadata that is writable and readable by humans and machines;
- creating tooling, and technical infrastructure that lower the barriers to working with software citation metadata;
- working with software citation experts, open source developers, research software engineers and metadata projects and their users to ensure that our outputs are usable and useful, and meet their requirements;
- creating a welcoming and inclusive community, where we work equitably and are valued, to help each other and achieve our goals; and
- advocating for better software citation practice.

This work is important because, when software is cited, 1) research software becomes part of the scholarly record, and 2) the people that create the software receive credit for their work. Citing software also creates provenance for research and enables reproducibility.

## Scope

The Citation File Format project specifically focuses on citation metadata for software. Within this scope, development of the Citation File Format schema takes into account evolution and progress in software citation to implement good practices and the state of the art.
