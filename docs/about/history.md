# A brief history of the Citation File Format

## Predecessors

On 30 August 2013, [Robin Wilson](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7352-8912) - fellow of the British [Software Sustainability Institute (SSI)](https://software.ac.uk) - published a blog post
that was [re-published on the SSI's blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20231123110743/https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/encouraging-citation-software-introducing-citation-files).
In this post, he proposes the addition of **plaintext files named `CITATION`** to source code repositories.
These files should contain information about how to cite the respective software.

## A standard format for `CITATION` files?

Based on [Robin Wilson's previous work](#predecessors), [Stephan Druskat](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4925-7248) proposed a
standard format for `CITATION` files in a [lightning talk]((https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3827058.v4)) at the [Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences (WSSSPE5.1)](https://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe5-1/)
on 06 September 2017 in Manchester, UK.
The proposal was discussed further at the workshop, and the outcomes of the discussion published in a [blog post on the SSI blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20231123113500/https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/standard-format-citation-files). The discussion group defined **requirements for a standard format for `CITATION` files**, such as support for: human- and machine-readability, human-writability, a dedicated reference type for software, version identifiers, persistent identifiers, release dates, software authors and their [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/)s, references to the described software's dependencies and other works. Additionally, the format should be compatible with other metadata formats, and should support Unicode.

Between the discussion at the workshop and the publication of the blog post on 12 December 2017,
Stephan Druskat started specifying a format that would meet the discussed requirements on 19 September 2017, and published the **first draft of the Citation File Format** ([0.9-RC1](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1003150)) on 06 October 2017.
